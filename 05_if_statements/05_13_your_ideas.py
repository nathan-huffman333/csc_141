"""
As my programming skills continue to develop, there are many things that I'm interested in trying out.
For example, now that I understand for loops, lists, and conditional statements, I'm thinking about how I could use them together.
A list would be perfect for a video game inventory, and a for loop would be great for displaying the items in the inventory.
Also, conditional statements could be used to trigger certain events depending on what is inside the inventory.
Using this ability, things like allowing the player to open a door because they possess a key becomes possible.  
Or, another things that lists and conditional statments could be used for is turn-based rpgs.
If a list is filled with all of the commands a player can choose from, whenever they pick an action, an if statement can determine the outcome.
