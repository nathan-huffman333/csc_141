# I designed the code to print my favorite pizza types and write a unique sentence about each of them.

pizzas = ["pepperoni", "cheese", "stuffed crust"]

print("\n")
for x in pizzas:
    print(x)
print("\n")

for x in pizzas:
    print("I like " + x + " pizza.")
print("\n")

print("When I was younger, I only liked "+ pizzas[1] + " pizza.")
print("Now, my all time favorite, even if it is simple, is "+ pizzas[0] + " pizza.")
print("I've only had "+pizzas[2]+" pizza a few times, and while it is really good, it's a LOT of cheese.\n")


print("I love pizza, I think I could probably eat it every day without complaining.\n")
