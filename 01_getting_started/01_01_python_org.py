"""

On the python website, there were examples of things such as functions, variables, while and for loops, lists, the print command, and more.

There's a lot of helpful resources to learn how to do things at beginner, intermediate, and master levels, and access to many different books about python, as well as libraries.

There's also a community tab, and it seems like they have python events every once and a while. Another thing they have is some tutorials, both text based and audio.

I also looked at the source release page, and there's versions of python dating back all the way back to 2001, and I also noticed that python is open source.
