I've taken a programming class before that used python, so I understand some concepts and how to program them such as if-else, functions, while and for loops, variables, and lists.

My previous knowledge of python will definitely help me throughout the course, especially at the beginning and to help me learn new commands since I understand basic coding logic. 

However, I've never programmed anything with any visual aspect to python, so working with imported libraries and creating things like graphs will be completely new to me.

I think I'm a pretty quick learner though, and that it will be interesting to learn some new things to help create more complicated programs.

I also love video games and have some basic understanding of their logic, so being able to learn more about coding and possibly being able to create my own game would be great.
